# Psycholinguistic Validation of CWI model Using `DeveL` dataset: Data and analysis code
This folder contains data and statistical analysis carried out to provide a psycholinguistic validation of the complexity estimates generated by the CWI model. We re-analyzed a dataset of 1152 German nouns from the Developmental Lexicon Project (DeveL,484 Schröter and Schroeder, 2017).

## Files
- `data_devel_cwi.csv`: Unless explicitely descrived below, the information from in this data file comes from the DeveL dataset (Schröter & Schroeder1, 2017), available at: https://sites.google.com/view/saschaschroeder/downloads. Please refer to the published article for the documentation of DeveL: https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0851-9. The columns listed below describe the information added as part of the current publication.
    - `complexity_cwi`: This is the word complexity metric produced by the CWI model, which is provided for each of the 1152 German nouns in DeveL. It ranges from 0 (least complex) to 1 (most complex).
- `analysis_devel_cwi.R`: Statistical analysis reported in the paper.
